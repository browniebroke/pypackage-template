Cookiecutter template for a Python Package.

## Features

- Project for Python 3.6+.
- Testing with Pytest using Github actions.
- Packaging powered by [poetry]
- Follows the [black] style guide with [flake8] and [isort].
- Comes with [pre-commit] hook config for black, isort, flake8 and [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Style guide enforced on CI.
- Dependencies pinned with pip-compile and updated by [dependabot].
- Follow the [all-contributors] specification.
- Follow to [the conventional commits][conventional-commits] specification.
- Automated releasing using [python-semantic-release][python-semantic-release].
- Documentation configured with Sphinx and [MyST Parser][myst].
- Standardised list of Github labels synchronised on push to master using [the labels CLI][pylabels].

## Usage

Generate a new project with:

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/browniebroke/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

This will prompt you for a few questions and create new directory with the name you used as project slug.

### Start developing

The project uses [Poetry] for dependencies management and packaging. Make sure you have it installed in your development machine. To install the development dependencies in a virtual environment, type:

```shell
poetry install
```

This will also generate a `poetry.lock` file, you should track this file in version control. To execute the test suite, call pytest inside Poetry's virtual environment via `poetry run`:

```shell
poetry run pytest
```

Check out the [Poetry] documentation for more information on the available commands.

### Github Actions

When you first push to Github, it'll start a `ci` Github workflow that you can see in the "Actions" tab of your repository. This workflow runs a couple of jobs:

- The `test` job will run your test suite with Pytest against all Python version from 3.6 to 3.9
- A few things will run in the lint job:
   - black in check mode
   - isort in check mode
   - flake8
   - pyupgrade for Python 3.6+

A `labels` workflow will also run and synchronise the Github labels based on the `.github/labels.toml` file.

### Secrets

The workflows need [2 secrets][gh-secrets] to be setup in your Github repository:

- `PYPI_TOKEN` to publish a release to [PyPI][pypi] in the Publish to PyPI workflow.
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` to upload coverage data to [codecov.io][codecov] in the Test workflow (optional for public repos).

### Automated release

By following the conventional commits specification, we're able to completely automate versioning and releasing to PyPI. This is handled by the `semantic-release.yml` workflow. It is triggered manually by default, but can be configured to run on every push to your main branch.

Here is an overview of its features:

- Check the commit log since the last release, and determine the next version to be released.
- If no significant change detected, stop here (e.g. just dependencies update).
- Otherwise, bump the version in code locations specified in `setup.cfg`.
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Commit changes.
- Create a git tag.
- Push to Github.
- Create a release in Github with the changes as release notes.
- Build the source and binary distribution (wheel).
- Upload the sources to PyPI and attach them to the Github release.

For more details, check out the [conventional commits website][conventional-commits] and [Python semantic release][python-semantic-release] Github action.

### Pre-commit

The project comes with the config for [pre-commit]. If you're not familiar with it, follow their documentation on how to install it and set it up.

### Documentation

The project assumes that the documentation will be hosted on Read the Docs and written in Markdown with the [MyST parser for Sphinx][myst]. 

To enable it, you might need to go [into your dashboard][rtd-dashboard] and import the project from Github. Everything else should work out of the box.

### All contributors

This is a specification that help you highlight all of the open source contributions on your README. This is easy to maintain as it comes with a Github bot to do the updates for you, so more manual updates on the contributors file.

If you never used it before, you will have to [install the Github app][all-contribs-install] and give it access to your repo.
